# Cybersecurity Homelab

*  Successfully configured a homelab using Microsoft Azure equipped with a SIEM tool to monitor all security events.
 
*  Implemented a VM with port 3389 left open to allow users to attempt to connect via RDP to the machine which provided me with data that could be analyzed.
  
*  Utilized Dashboard to view all new events, alerts, and incidents.

*  Deployed a rule that would automatically create a Incident for "Successful Local Sign Ins".
