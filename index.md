# Cybersecurity Homelab

*  Successfully configured a homelab using Microsoft Azure equipped with a SIEM tool to monitor all security events.
*  Implemented a VM with port 3389 left open to allow users to attempt to connect to the machine which allowed for data to be collected and monitored.
*  Deployed a rule that would automatically create a Incident for "Successful Local Sign Ins".
